demo_player
=================

A javascript/canvas animation player. The animations is prebuilt by creating a 'screenplay' in the 'language' of the player. And then the player just does it's job and plays them. This was a part of school project, so it was done in short terms. Look out for undewater rocks :) The source can be used as you find suitable, just give me a credit.

Thanks to guys from kinetic.js. Really sped up my dev process.
